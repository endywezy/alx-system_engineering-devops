Load Balancer Feedback Loop Incident Postmortem
Overview
This README provides a detailed postmortem of a significant incident where a misconfigured load balancer created a feedback loop, causing our primary web application to become slow and often unresponsive. The postmortem includes a summary of the incident, a detailed timeline of events, the root cause, resolution steps, and preventive measures to avoid future occurrences.

Issue Summary
Duration of Outage: 2024-06-01 14:00 UTC - 2024-06-01 16:30 UTC
Impact:
The primary web application was significantly slow and often unresponsive, affecting around 60% of users. Page load times exceeded 30 seconds, causing many users to experience timeouts.
Root Cause: A misconfigured load balancer created a feedback loop, overloading the servers and causing widespread performance issues.
Timeline
Detection and Initial Response:
14:00 UTC - Detection Time: Automated monitoring alert indicates increased response times and error rates.
14:05 UTC - Detection Method: Engineering team receives alerts and begins initial investigation.
The Rabbit Hole:
14:10 UTC - Actions Taken: Focus on database performance, suspecting high query volumes. Efforts include optimizing queries and indexing.
14:30 UTC - Misleading Investigations: Realization that database performance issues are a red herring as error rates continue to climb.
Escalation and Resolution:
14:45 UTC - Escalated to: DevOps team for a deeper inspection.
15:00 UTC - Resolution: DevOps team identifies a feedback loop in the load balancer configuration. Misrouting rules are corrected, and services are restarted.
Root Cause and Resolution
The Real Culprit:
Root Cause Explanation: The load balancer was misconfigured, causing a feedback loop that resulted in servers continuously resending requests, leading to overload and high response times.
Fixing the Beat:
Resolution Explanation: The DevOps team reviewed and corrected the load balancer configuration, eliminating the feedback loop. Services were restarted to ensure normal operation.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Lessons Learned:
Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance the process for reviewing and validating load balancer configurations.
Implement robust monitoring tools to detect abnormal traffic patterns early.
Conduct regular training sessions for engineers on load balancer configurations and network diagnostics.
Actionable Tasks:
Patch Load Balancer Software: Upgrade to the latest version to benefit from recent improvements.
Implement Health Checks: Regular health checks for the load balancer.
Monitor Traffic Patterns: Advanced monitoring solutions to detect unusual traffic patterns.
Configuration Audits: Regular audits of load balancer and network settings.
Update Incident Response Documentation: Include steps for diagnosing and resolving load balancer issues.
Conclusion
The incident highlighted the critical importance of correctly configuring load balancers and having comprehensive monitoring systems in place. By enhancing our processes, training, and tools, we aim to prevent similar disruptions in the future. Regular audits and improved incident response protocols will be key in ensuring our systems’ resilience.
